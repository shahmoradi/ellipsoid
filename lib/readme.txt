For Travis:

- do not fully trust the procedure descriptions provided in the srouce codes. Some of them (perhaps very few) may be worng and old descriptions. These library files are still under active development.

- make sure you follow the same naming convensions in your own codes as the one used in these files, in order to improve code readability and consistency.

- There are occasionally multiple procedures that do exact same task, but with different input, or with different procedure interface (for example there are multiple functions and subroutines that calculate matrix determinant). These redundancies exist intentionally, and procedure is written for a specific situation, in order to maximize the runtime speed of the calling code. If you had any questions or doubt about which one to use in your own code, feel free ask me anytime.
